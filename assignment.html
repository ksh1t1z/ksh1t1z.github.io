                <h3>Call By Value</h3>
                In this method, a copy of the value is passed to the function.
                Changes made inside the function is limited to the function only and the
                values of the actual parameters do not change by changing the formal parameters.
                And in this method, actual and formal arguements are created at different memory location.

                In this method, address of variable is passed into the function.
                The changes made inside the dunction remain outside the function too.
                The values of the actual parameters also change the formal parameters.
                The actual and formal arguements are created at the same memory location.

                <h2>Question 3</h2>
                <p>
                    There are four types of storage class in C, they are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>auto</li>
                    <li>extern</li>
                    <li>static</li>
                    <li>register</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>Auto:</strong><br />
                    This is default storage class for all the variables declared inside a function.
                    Hencem the keyword is rarely used while programming in C.
                    Auto variables can only be accessed within the function they have been declared in, though they can
                    be accessed in nested functions if its declared in the parent nest.
                    However using pointers can give them global scope. They are assigned a garbage value whenever
                    they're declared.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Extern: </strong><br />
                    This variable is declared outside any function. They can be overwritten inside a function.
                    It is a global variable which can use used anywhere. It is declared by using the "extern" keyword.
                    This is used to access the variable at global scope and not declae a global variable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Static: </strong><br />
                    This storage class is very popular in C programming language. Static variable preserve their value
                    even after they are out of scope. Hence, they preserve the value of their last used scope. They are
                    initialized only once and exist till the termination of the program. Their scope is local to the
                    function in which they are declared. Global static variables can be asscesed anywhere in the
                    program. Theya are assigned the value
                    0 by compiler.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Register: </strong><br />
                    This is similar to auto stoage class, diffeence being it tries to store variable in register instead
                    of memory in case once of the register is free. If a register is not free, its stores in memory
                    only. Register variables greatly improves the run time of a program. To be noted that we cannot
                    obtain the address of a register variable using pointers.
